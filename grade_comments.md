|     2     |   3    |     0         | So if we use binary search tree it will take O(L * Log n), Where L = length of the word to be searched, and n = total number of words. O(log n), O(n) also acceptable.
|     3     |   3    |     0         | If we use prefix tree, it will take O(L), Where L = length of the word to be searched. At the maximum it will be 26 only.

|     5     |   3    |     0         | If we don't use 'IsPrefix' in 'SolveBoard' the 'SolveBoard' function will find the words which are not in dictionary also and compare them with words in dictionary then eleminate, so it will take more time to complete this process, If we use 'IsPrefix' we can eliminate the words by making prefix searches of that word instead of finding all the words in that path, So that it will be cost effective if we use 'IsPrefix'.
